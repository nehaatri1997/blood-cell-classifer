# blood-cell-classifer

# Overview
This Python script is designed to classify blood cells into different types using a machine learning model. It uses image data to detect and label various blood cell types, providing a valuable tool for biomedical analysis and health research.

# Features
Image Processing: Reads and preprocesses blood cell images for classification.
Machine Learning: Utilizes a trained model to predict and classify blood cell types.
Evaluation: Outputs the predicted blood cell type and can evaluate model accuracy on test datasets.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Required libraries:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
Getting Started
1. Model Setup
Make sure to have a trained model ready or follow the instructions in the script to train a new model on a dataset of labeled blood cell images.

2. Dataset
Provide a labeled dataset of blood cell images. Organize the dataset into folders representing each blood cell type (e.g., Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets).

3. Running the Script
Run the script to classify blood cells from a given image or dataset:

python blood_cell_classifier.py

# Usage
Load the Model: The script loads a pre-trained model or trains a new model if no model exists.
Image Classification: Specify the path to an image, and the script will classify the blood cell type.
Evaluation Mode: If a test set is available, the script can evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.

# Example
Classifying image: RBC_sample.jpg
Predicted cell type: Red Blood Cell

# Notes
Data Quality: Ensure images are high quality and well-labeled for best model performance.
Model Training: If training from scratch, expect longer runtimes based on dataset size.

# Troubleshooting
Model Errors: Check that the model path and dataset paths are correctly specified.
Dependency Issues: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
